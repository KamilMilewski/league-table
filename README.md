# Welcome to LeagueTable

## What is LeagueTable

The LeagueTable class is used to store results of football (soccer) matches played, as well as return and display various stats about each team.

The LeagueTable class requires an array of strings called matches which stores the results of matches played.

LeagueTable expects results to always be passed as a String in the format:
```
"Home Team 0 - 0 Away Team"
```
for example:
```
"Man Utd 3 - 0 Liverpool".
```

## The class has following methods
```
get_points(team_name) # Returns the no. of points a team has, 0 by default
get_goals_for(team_name) # Returns the no. of goals a team has scored, 0 by default
get_goals_against(team_name) # Returns the no. of goals a team has conceeded (had scored against them), 0 by default
get_goal_difference(team_name) # Return the no. of goals a team has scored minus the no. of goals a team has conceeded, 0 by default
get_wins(team_name) # Return the no. of wins a team has, 0 by default
get_draws(team_name) # Return the no. of draws a team has, 0 by default

```
